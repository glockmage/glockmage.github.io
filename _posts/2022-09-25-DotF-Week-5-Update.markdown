35 days ago I began work on this project, Death of the Forefathers, as a submission to the 2022.2 Brackeys "You are not alone" GameJam.
As stated in the first post on this Devblog series, we were unable to submit an entry due to not having a complete product. 
Since then, I have worked every day to complete this project, committing as much time as I can in-between studies and other parts of life.

If you read the previous blog, you may remember that I imposed some deadlines and that I wished to complete the project by September 30th.
That would also mean that this would be the Level Design week, alongside any other polishing that might occur.
That is not what ended up happening. I was unable to dedicate as many hours as I had predicted, and alongside with that I did not
follow the schedule beat for beat. There was a shift in direction, and as such all those original plans went out the window.
That original plan was to finish the game by the end of the month, and any other features would essentially be left on the chopping room floor.
However I wasn't the most interested in that. I felt like the game would be forgettable, bland, and unexciting if I restricted myself to the
bare-minimum schedule I had imposed on myself previously. So the things I implemented changed somewhat, and the Skill Tree feature that I
was planning to axe ended up being reconstructed from the ground up.

So for a brief overview of what I have implemented since the end of week 3:

#### Damage Popups
Numbers appear representing the amount of damage dealt by any given attack.

#### Attack Combos & Other Reworked Aspects



In many games, attacking consecutively does more than play the same attack animation. Oftentimes there will be multiple unique animations, 
with each additional hit dealing unique damage amounts and changing in speed respectively. This mechanic can be really good for gamefeel,
as it especially stops this feeling of "poke" or "fencing-like" gameplay, where you are somewhat mind-numbingly walking backwards and forwards.

So here you can see
